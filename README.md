gnSPADE is a reference-free SPAtial DEconvolution method incorporating gene network structures for spatial transcriptomics. gnSPADE requires the gene count matrix and gene network structures derived from existing databases such as the PPI network, KEGG pathway and Reactome. It builds upon the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to recover cell-type compositions and transcriptional profiles within each spatial location, without relying on external single-cell reference information.
